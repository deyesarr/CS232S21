Midpoint Failures

We used the inputs 2147483647 in both x and y spots to induce a failure. This caused midpoint original to fail because that is the max value that function can hold. However, midpoint_a worked properly. 

Next we used the inputs 2 and INT_MAX to cause failure. 

Next we tried -1 and INT_MIN
